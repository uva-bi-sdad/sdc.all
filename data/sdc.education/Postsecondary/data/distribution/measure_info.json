Catchment areas were calculated using (a) 2-year schools with any degrees conferred in the given year with a CIP code starting with 41, as listed by the National Center for Education Statistics, with supply values of 1, (b) Census block groups, with supply values as the population over the age of 14 as reported the American Community Survey 5-year summaries, and (c) distances between school locations and block group centroids, weighted by a Gaussian function with a scaling parameter set to 18, as calculated by the catchment R package.",
