Poor job access can include barriers such as distance from residents and transportation availability. The employment access index is obtained from the Housing + Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index data provided by Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT).  H+T calculated the index using a gravity model. The index is calculated by summing the total number of jobs divided by the square of the distance to those jobs. The index is based on jobs and distance decay function. We downloaded and cleaned the dataset from the CNT H+T index website for years 2015, 2019, and 2020.",
