The index of affordability is calculated by combining housing and transportation costs in a neighborhood and dividing that number by income . H+T index provides three different affordability index to account for different households like Regional Typical Household, Regional Moderate Household and National Typical Household. In our analysis, we focused on the Regional Typical Household. \n We downloaded and cleaned the dataset from the CNT H+T index website for years 2015, 2019, and 2020.  To fill in the missing data for the years 2016-2018, we performed interpolation using the available data points from 2015 and 2019. Additionally, for the year 2021, we estimated employment access values by multiplying the rate of change observed from 2019 to 2020 by the values for the year 2020.

Earnings per job is total earnings divided by total number of jobs. Total earnings is the sum of wages and salaries, supplements to wages and salaries, and proprietor\u2019s income. Wages and salaries refer to the monetary remuneration of employees; it includes compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses, compensation plans, such as 401(k) plans; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, that represent income to the recipient. Supplements to wages and salaries consists of employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and employer contributions for government social insurance. Proprietor\u2019s income is the current-production income (including the income in kind) of sole proprietorships and partnerships and of tax-exempt cooperatives.\n\nRaw data observations are generally per county/city; however, some observations involve multiple counties/cities. For example, Fairfax County, Fairfax City and Falls Church City are grouped into one observation in the raw data.  We split the multi-county/city raw data observations into multiple observations so that one observation corresponds to only one county/city.
